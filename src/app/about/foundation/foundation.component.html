      <b>We Are M.A.D. (making a difference) is the charity arm of Fullerton Markets.</b> We partner with different communities
      to help educate and equip people for sustainable change. Our initiatives include activities in orphanages and halfway
      houses all over Asia. We believe that children are the future pillars of society, and that all their dreams can come
      true if they never give up on themselves.

        20th Jan 2018 - Charity Event in Batam (Indonesia)
      </div>
      <p>
        Fullerton Markets travelled to Batam, on 20th January 2018 for our annual company retreat! All staff members were required
        to build bicycles as part of a team bonding exercise. The assembled bicycles were donated to the children of the
        Vistos Kasih Ikhlas & Al Fateh Orphanage. As a token of their appreciation, the children keenly demonstrated to us
        their creative sides and talents by performing songs and dances for us!
