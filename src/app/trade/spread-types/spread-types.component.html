      Fullerton Marketâ€™s foreign currency pairs are based on floating spreads priced from our Tier-1 Liquidity Providers (LPs).
      Price spreads vary throughout the day depending on factors such as available liquidity (supply and demand), market
      forces, volatility, and the trading session.

      <li>
        Variable Spreads on the Fullerton Markets MT4 platform are derived from our Tier-1 Liquidity Providers in Equinix LD4 (a
        FX-specific data center in London). There are no commissions charged for trade execution, but a brokerage fee is
        collected from the spreads.
      </li>
      <li>
        ECN Spreads are derived from an Electronic Communication Network (ECN) that is set up with multiple Liquidity Providers,
        including banks and hedge funds in Equinix LD4 (a FX-specific data center in London). Traders get to enjoy raw spreads
        for as low as 0.1 pips direct from the market participants at a flat fee of only 10 USD per lot in commission charged
        for Forex instruments.
